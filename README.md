This project is created from create-react-app as a boiler-plate.
For this project I used scss as pre-processor for css and bootstrap for the styling. I did not write too much css since it is not in the requirement. (Css is one of most strongest points)

I also used redux and redux-thunk for application state.

For testing I used Jest with Enzyme. I tested the most important components and not the containers.

Use these command;
1. To Install Node Packages. - `npm install`
2. To Run Project - `npm start`
3. To Run Tests - `npm test`
